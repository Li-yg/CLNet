# CLNet: Real-Time Pilot Cognitive Load Monitoring
 
Thank you for your interest in CLNet. This repository will provide:
 
- **Source code** for the CLNet architecture  
- **Pretrained model weights**  
- A **small dataset slice** for quick start  
 
All materials will be released upon manuscript acceptance. We appreciate your patience and look forward to sharing our work.
 

# Introduction
 
The rapid evolution of intelligent flight cockpits necessitates real-time monitoring of pilots’ cognitive load to ensure safety. CLNet (Cognitive Load Network) is a novel, ultra-lightweight neural architecture—just 27 K parameters—designed for accurate, millisecond-scale classification of pilot workload (low, medium, high).

## ATPCL Dataset
 
*Partial dataset slice to be uploaded upon manuscript acceptance for testing.*
 
The Airfield Traffic Pattern Cognitive Load (ATPCL) dataset was recorded on a flight simulator during the cruise, takeoff, and landing phases. It includes:  
- 15 professionally trained cadets from Beihang University  
- Completion of a five-leg flight task sequence  
- Simultaneous EEG, EMG, and ECG signal recordings
